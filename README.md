## Description

This module provides a collection of facts plans all of which retrieve facts from the specified nodes but each of them processes the retrieved facts differently (if at all). The provided plans are:
* `facts` - retrieves the facts and then stores them in the inventory, returns a result set wrapping result objects for each specified node which in turn wrap the retrieved facts
* `facts::info` - retrieves the facts and returns information about each node's OS compiled from the `os` fact value retrieved from that node
* `facts::retrieve` - retrieves the facts and without further processing returns a result set wrapping result objects for each specified node which in turn wrap the retrieved facts (this plan is internally used by the other two)

## Requirements

This module is compatible with the version of Puppet Bolt it ships with.

## Usage

To run the facts plan run

```
bolt plan run facts --nodes node1.example.com,node2.example.com
```

### Parameters

All plans have only one parameter:

* **nodes** - The nodes to retrieve the facts from.

## Reference

The core functionality is implemented in the `facts::retrieve` plan, which
runs the `facts::bash` task for `ssh://` (and possibly `local://` if the bash
shell is available on the local host) targets, the `facts::powershell` task
for `winrm://` targets and `facts::ruby` for `pcp://` targets. Other targets
are currently not supported. The tasks either run `facter --json` command if
facter is available on the target and return its output or - as a fallback -
compile and return information mimicking that provided by the facter's `os`
fact. The plan then collects the results of the task runs on the individual
nodes and returns them wrapped in a ResultSet object.
